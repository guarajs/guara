# Guara
Guara is collection of Polymer custom components that wrap Bootstrap components, plus some new stuff like &lt;g-table&gt;, &lt;g-excel&gt; and &lt;g-remote-file&gt;

# Getting Started

If you know [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org), the easiest way to get started is by adding guara-elements#master as a bower dependency and incluing guara-elements.html in your index.html.  

```html
<link rel="import" href="bower/guara-elements/guara-elements.html">
```

*Please note that guara-elements.html will import all guara elements and polymer*  

If you don't know Polymer, I'm sorry :)
